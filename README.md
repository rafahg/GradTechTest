## CHALLENGE

Write some code to implement the function `createMenuData`

Use the test runner `jest` to run the `gradTest.test.js` 

I have included my approach to the challenge in this separeted Readme file.

 [Challenge Approach]()

### TIPS

The data set in the test ends at parent 4, but imagine any number of parents and children could be passed to this function.

When the test passes clean up your code.
It's worth spending time formatting and simplifing thins.
It's more important that humans can read your code than computers.
Software tools like `eslint` do some amazing things ðŸ•¶
